# Alcohol-Detector-and-Engine-Locking-System-Using-Arduino-Uno-and-MQ3-Sensor
The Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System is a technologically advanced solution 
designed to mitigate the risks of drunk driving by automatically detecting a driver's alcohol 
consumption and disabling the vehicle’s ignition if the detected alcohol level exceeds the legal 
threshold. This system employs an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to measure the blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) from the driver’s breath.
An Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the sensor data and compares it against a predefined 
BAC threshold. When the BAC level exceeds the set limit, the system activates an engine lock 
mechanism using a relay, effectively preventing the vehicle from starting or operating further. 
Additionally, the system provides real-time feedback through an LCD display, LED indicators, 
and a buzzer, alerting the driver about the detected alcohol levels.
This intelligent, compact, and cost-effective system is compatible with various vehicle types and 
can be discreetly installed, making it a practical solution for enhancing road safety. By reducing 
alcohol-related traffic accidents, the system has the potential to serve as a significant public safety 
tool.
Future developments could focus on integrating this system directly into vehicle manufacturing 
processes, paving the way for a new standard in automobile safety technology. Such advancements 
would not only improve reliability but also contribute to reducing drunk driving incidents on a 
larger scale.
This project highlights a step forward in leveraging smart instrumentation and control 
technologies for real-world applications, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and innovation.
