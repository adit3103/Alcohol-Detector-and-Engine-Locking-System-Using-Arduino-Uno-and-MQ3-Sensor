- **Modular Design**: Each component (sensor, alert system, relay) functions as a module, simplifying troubleshooting and possible upgrades.
- **Compact Integration**: The system is designed to be compact for easy installation within vehicles, allowing for hidden placement while ensuring accurate detection.

### 3. Algorithm and Workflow

The following step-by-step algorithm describes the system's operation:

1. **Start System**: Upon power-up, the Arduino initializes all components, setting the alcohol sensor and display.
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: The MQ-3 sensor continuously monitors the driver’s breath for alcohol levels.
3. **Read Sensor Data**: If the alcohol level is detected above 0 ppm, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino.
4. **Threshold Comparison**: Arduino compares the detected level to the preset threshold.
    - If the detected alcohol level is below the threshold, the vehicle operates normally.
    - If the detected level exceeds the threshold, the system proceeds to the next steps.
5. **Alert Activation**: The buzzer sounds, the LED turns on, and the LCD displays a warning message indicating high alcohol levels.
6. **Ignition Lock**: The relay is triggered by the Arduino to interrupt the ignition circuit, preventing the engine from starting.
7. **Continuous Check and Reset**: The system periodically checks alcohol levels; if levels drop below the threshold, the relay disengages, allowing the engine to start.

### 4. Flowchart

The flowchart for the system includes the following stages:
- Start → Initialize Components → Read Alcohol Level → Threshold Check → Activate Alert (If Above Threshold) → Ignition Lock → Continuous Check for Reset.

This design approach ensures a high degree of reliability by enabling the system to make quick, real-time decisions based on the driver’s BAC levels. The use of Arduino also allows flexibility for modifications, making this system an effective and adaptable tool for vehicle safety against impaired driving.
