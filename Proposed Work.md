**ALGORITHM**

The design of the alcohol detection and engine locking system aims to create a safety mechanism that prevents vehicle operation when the driver is under the influence of alcohol. This system uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor for detection, an Arduino Uno microcontroller for processing, and a relay module to control the ignition system. Here’s a breakdown of the approach, system model, and operational algorithm: 
1. **System Model and Hardware Design:** <br>
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor: This sensor detects alcohol vapor in the driver’s breath, providing an analog output proportional to the concentration of alcohol. Arduino Uno Microcontroller: The ATmega328-based Arduino Uno is the core processing unit that receives input from the alcohol sensor, processes it, and sends commands to other components. Relay Module: When the detected alcohol level exceeds a preset threshold, the relay module is activated by the Arduino to cut off the ignition, preventing the vehicle from starting. Buzzer and LED Indicator: These components serve as alert mechanisms. The buzzer sounds an audible alert when alcohol is detected, and the LED provides a visual warning. LCD Display: Displays real-time alcohol concentration and warning messages for the driver. <br><br>
2. **Design Approach:**<br>
Threshold Setting: The system is calibrated to detect alcohol levels in line with legal limits (e.g., 0.08 mg/L BAC). This threshold is programmed in the Arduino to ensure timely responses to different levels of alcohol detected. Modular Design: Each component (sensor, alert system, relay)functions as a module, simplifying troubleshooting and possible upgrades. Compact Integration: The system is designed to be compact for easy installation within vehicles, allowing for hidden placement while ensuring accurate detection. <br><br>
3. **Algorithm and Workflow:** <br>
The following step-by-step algorithm describes the system's operation;
<br>&#8658; Start System: Upon power-up, the Arduino initializes all components, setting the alcohol sensor and 
display. 
<br>&#8658; Continuous Monitoring: The MQ-3 sensor continuously monitors the driver’s breath for alcohol levels. 
<br>&#8658; Read Sensor Data: If the alcohol level is detected above 0 ppm, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino. 
<br>&#8658; Threshold Comparison: Arduino compares the detected level to the preset threshold. If the detected alcohol level is below the threshold, the vehicle operates normally. If the detected level exceeds the threshold, the system proceeds to the next steps. 
<br>&#8658; Alert Activation: The buzzer sounds, the LED turns on, and the LCD displays a warning message indicating high alcohol levels. 
<br>&#8658; Ignition Lock: The relay is triggered by the Arduino to interrupt the ignition circuit, preventing the engine from starting. 
<br>&#8658; Continuous Check and Reset: The system periodically checks alcohol levels; if levels drop below the threshold, the relay disengages, allowing the engine to start. <br><br>
4. Flowchart<br>
   The flowchart for the system includes the following stages: <br>Start → Initialize Components → Read Alcohol Level → Threshold Check → Activate Alert (If Above Threshold) → Ignition Lock → Continuous Check for Reset. <br>This design approach ensures a high degree of reliability by enabling the system to make quick, real-time decisions based on the driver’s BAC levels. The use of Arduino also allows flexibility for modifications, making this system an effective and adaptable tool for vehicle safety against impaired driving

**TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS**

The Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System using Arduino Uno and MQ-3 sensor is a preventive 
system designed to detect alcohol levels in a driver’s breath and disable the vehicle’s ignition if alcohol 
is detected above a set threshold. Here is a detailed technical description of the system’s core components, 
functioning, and operation: 
1. Core Components 
• Arduino Uno (ATmega328 Microcontroller): The Arduino Uno acts as the system’s central 
processing unit. It collects data from the MQ-3 sensor, processes the readings, and triggers 
necessary actions (such as alerts or engine locking) based on the programmed threshold. It’s 
equipped with digital and analog input/output pins that facilitate connections with various 
components such as the LCD, relay, LED indicators, and buzzer. 
• MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor: This sensor is sensitive to alcohol vapors and is used to measure the driver’s 
BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration) from their breath. It outputs an analog signal based on the 
concentration of alcohol, which the Arduino Uno reads through an analog input pin. 
• Relay Module: The relay module acts as a switch that is controlled by the Arduino. If alcohol is 
detected above the defined threshold, the Arduino signals the relay to interrupt the vehicle’s 
ignition circuit, effectively locking the engine to prevent operation. 
• Buzzer and LED Indicator: These components serve as an alert system. If alcohol is detected, the 
LED indicator lights up, and the buzzer emits an audible sound to warn the driver and anyone 
nearby about the detected alcohol level. 
• LCD Display: The LCD module is used to display real-time information, such as the detected 
alcohol level or warning messages when alcohol is above the threshold. 
2. System Functioning and Operation 
• Initialization: When the system is powered on, the Arduino Uno initializes the sensor and display 
modules. The system is designed to continuously monitor alcohol levels through the MQ-3 sensor. 
• Detection and Analysis: The MQ-3 sensor measures the alcohol level in the driver’s breath and 
sends an analog signal to the Arduino Uno. This signal is then converted into a digital reading that 
represents the concentration of alcohol.

• Threshold Evaluation: A pre-defined threshold, generally aligned with the legal limit for BAC, is 
set within the Arduino program. If the detected alcohol level is below this threshold, the system 
allows the vehicle to operate normally. If the detected level exceeds this threshold, the system 
activates safety protocols. 
• Alert and Engine Locking: When the alcohol level crosses the threshold: 
o The buzzer sounds to alert the driver and nearby passengers. 
o The LCD display shows a warning message indicating a high alcohol concentration. o The 
relay module is triggered, which interrupts the ignition circuit, locking the engine to prevent 
the vehicle from starting. 
• Continuous Monitoring and Reset: The system continuously monitors the alcohol level. If the level 
drops below the threshold after an initial detection, the system automatically resets, disengaging 
the relay and allowing the engine to start. 
3. Technical Flow 
• Sensor Input: The MQ-3 sensor provides an analog signal to the Arduino based on the detected 
alcohol concentration. 
• Signal Processing: The Arduino processes the signal and checks it against the preset threshold. 
• Output Action: Based on the signal level, the Arduino triggers the relay, buzzer, and LED to either 
lock or unlock the engine. 
4. Advantages and Considerations 
• Advantages: This system is cost-effective, compact, and easy to install, making it suitable for 
various vehicle types. It is highly responsive, ensuring real-time alerts and immediate action to 
prevent drunk driving. 
• Considerations: To avoid false positives, the sensor should be regularly calibrated. Environmental 
factors, such as temperature and humidity, can influence sensor readings and may require 
additional components for accuracy
