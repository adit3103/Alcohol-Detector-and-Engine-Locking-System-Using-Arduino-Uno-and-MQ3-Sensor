**Algorithm**
The design of the alcohol detection and engine locking system aims to create a safety mechanism that 
prevents vehicle operation when the driver is under the influence of alcohol. This system uses an MQ-3 
alcohol sensor for detection, an Arduino Uno microcontroller for processing, and a relay module to control 
the ignition system. Here’s a breakdown of the approach, system model, and operational algorithm: 
1. System Model and Hardware Design 
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor: This sensor detects alcohol vapor in the driver’s breath, providing an analog output 
proportional to the concentration of alcohol. 
Arduino Uno Microcontroller: The ATmega328-based Arduino Uno is the core processing unit that 
receives input from the alcohol sensor, processes it, and sends commands to other components. 
Relay Module: When the detected alcohol level exceeds a preset threshold, the relay module is activated 
by the Arduino to cut off the ignition, preventing the vehicle from starting. Buzzer and LED Indicator: 
These components serve as alert mechanisms. The buzzer sounds an audible alert when alcohol is 
detected, and the LED provides a visual warning. 
LCD Display: Displays real-time alcohol concentration and warning messages for the driver. 
2. Design Approach 
Threshold Setting: The system is calibrated to detect alcohol levels in line with legal limits (e.g., 0.08 
mg/L BAC). This threshold is programmed in the Arduino to ensure timely responses to different levels 
of alcohol detected. 
Modular Design: Each component (sensor, alert system, relay) functions as a module, simplifying 
troubleshooting and possible upgrades. 
Compact Integration: The system is designed to be compact for easy installation within vehicles, allowing 
for hidden placement while ensuring accurate detection. 
3. Algorithm and Workflow 
The following step-by-step algorithm describes the system's operation:

Start System: Upon power-up, the Arduino initializes all components, setting the alcohol sensor and 
display. 
Continuous Monitoring: The MQ-3 sensor continuously monitors the driver’s breath for alcohol levels. 
Read Sensor Data: If the alcohol level is detected above 0 ppm, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino. 
Threshold Comparison: Arduino compares the detected level to the preset threshold. 
If the detected alcohol level is below the threshold, the vehicle operates normally. 
If the detected level exceeds the threshold, the system proceeds to the next steps. 
Alert Activation: The buzzer sounds, the LED turns on, and the LCD displays a warning message 
indicating high alcohol levels. 
Ignition Lock: The relay is triggered by the Arduino to interrupt the ignition circuit, preventing the engine 
from starting. 
Continuous Check and Reset: The system periodically checks alcohol levels; if levels drop below the 
threshold, the relay disengages, allowing the engine to start. 
4. Flowchart 
The flowchart for the system includes the following stages: 
Start → Initialize Components → Read Alcohol Level → Threshold Check → Activate Alert (If 
Above Threshold) → Ignition Lock → Continuous Check for Reset. This design approach ensures a 
high degree of reliability by enabling the system to make quick, real-time decisions based on the 
driver’s BAC levels. The use of Arduino also allows flexibility for modifications, making this system an 
effective and adaptable tool for vehicle safety against impaired driving
