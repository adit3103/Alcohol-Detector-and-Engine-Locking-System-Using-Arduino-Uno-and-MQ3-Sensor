**ALGORITHM**
---------------------
The design of the alcohol detection and engine locking system aims to create a safety mechanism that prevents vehicle operation when the driver is under the influence of alcohol. This system uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor for detection, an Arduino Uno microcontroller for processing, and a relay module to control the ignition system. Below is a breakdown of the approach, system model, and operational algorithm:

1. **System Model and Hardware Design:**
   - **MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor:**  
     Detects alcohol vapor in the driver’s breath, providing an analog output proportional to the concentration of alcohol.
   - **Arduino Uno Microcontroller:**  
     The core processing unit that receives input from the alcohol sensor, processes it, and sends commands to other components.
   - **Relay Module:**  
     Activated by Arduino when the detected alcohol level exceeds a preset threshold to cut off the ignition, preventing the vehicle from starting.
   - **Buzzer and LED Indicator:**  
     Alert mechanisms to warn the driver. The buzzer emits a sound when alcohol is detected, and the LED provides a visual warning.
   - **LCD Display:**  
     Displays real-time alcohol concentration and warning messages.

2. **Design Approach:**
   - **Threshold Setting:**  
     The system is calibrated to detect alcohol levels in line with legal limits (e.g., 0.08 mg/L BAC). The threshold is programmed in Arduino for timely responses.
   - **Modular Design:**  
     Each component (sensor, alert system, relay) functions as a module, simplifying troubleshooting and possible upgrades.
   - **Compact Integration:**  
     Designed to be compact for easy installation within vehicles, allowing for hidden placement while ensuring accurate detection.

3. **Algorithm and Workflow:**
   The following step-by-step algorithm describes the system's operation:

   → **Start System:** Upon power-up, the Arduino initializes all components, setting the alcohol sensor and display.  
   → **Continuous Monitoring:** The MQ-3 sensor continuously monitors the driver’s breath for alcohol levels.  
   → **Read Sensor Data:** If the alcohol level is detected above 0 ppm, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino.  
   → **Threshold Comparison:** Arduino compares the detected level to the preset threshold.  
     - If below the threshold, the vehicle operates normally.  
     - If above the threshold, proceed to the next steps.  
   → **Alert Activation:** The buzzer sounds, the LED turns on, and the LCD displays a warning message indicating high alcohol levels.  
   → **Ignition Lock:** The relay is triggered by the Arduino to interrupt the ignition circuit, preventing the engine from starting.  
   → **Continuous Check and Reset:** The system periodically checks alcohol levels. If the levels drop below the threshold, the relay disengages, allowing the engine to start.

4. **Flowchart:**
   Start → Initialize Components → Read Alcohol Level → Threshold Check → Activate Alert (If Above Threshold) → Ignition Lock → Continuous Check for Reset.

This design approach ensures a high degree of reliability by enabling the system to make quick, real-time decisions based on the driver’s BAC levels. The use of Arduino also allows flexibility for modifications, making this system an effective and adaptable tool for vehicle safety against impaired driving.

**TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS**
---------------------
The Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System using Arduino Uno and MQ-3 sensor is a preventive 
system designed to detect alcohol levels in a driver’s breath and disable the vehicle’s ignition if alcohol 
is detected above a set threshold.

**Core Components:**
---------------------

   - Acts as the system's central processing unit.
   - Collects data from the MQ-3 sensor and triggers necessary actions based on a programmed threshold.
   - Facilitates connections with components such as LCD, relay, LED indicators, and buzzer.

2. **MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor:**
   - Sensitive to alcohol vapors and measures the driver's BAC from their breath.
   - Outputs an analog signal to the Arduino Uno.

3. **Relay Module:**
   - Controlled by the Arduino to interrupt the ignition circuit when alcohol is detected above the threshold.

4. **Buzzer and LED Indicator:**
   - Alert system to notify the driver and others nearby.

5. **LCD Display:**
   - Displays real-time alcohol level or warning messages.

**System Functioning and Operation:**

4. **Alert and Engine Locking:**
   - Activates buzzer, shows warning on LCD, and interrupts ignition when alcohol exceeds the threshold.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Reset:**
   - System resets automatically if alcohol level drops below the threshold.

**Technical Flow:**
------------------
1. **Sensor Input:**
   - MQ-3 sensor provides an analog signal to Arduino.

2. **Signal Processing:**
   - Arduino processes the signal and compares it to the threshold.
